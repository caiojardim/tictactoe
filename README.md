<h1>TicTacToe</h1>

<p>This project had the idea of recreating the tictactoe game, I used google's tictactoe as a model</p>

<h3>Demo: https://cj-tictactoe.netlify.app/</h3>

<h2> What I learned with this project: </h2>
<ul>
    <li>Use font awesome</li>
    <li>Use querySelectorAll to interact with multiple elements with just one function</li>
    <li>Use event.currentTarget to get the button element instead of the icon</li>
</ul>

<h2> What I need to improve on this project: </h2>
<ul>
    <li>Refactor js by making functions that receive the game's button array and do the actions using forEach</li>
</ul>
